# STAR
A Slack Bot

A slack bot about satellites and astronomy

It is currently hosted on https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C095KDQD4JW

I used N2YO API to grab informations about satellites and Nasa API for astronomical photos
I had implemented a reddit meme fetcher but its not working rn
I have also implemented an API to display planet info

The commands are:

/star_scan <city> <number>

/star_visible_pass predicting visual pass

/star_radiopasses satellite passes visible via radio

/star_notify (Use this like this: /star_notify satellite_id city pass_type) notify about a pass visual or radio (You have to wait a bit until there is actually a pass coming)

/star_memes Sends memes about astronomy


/star_iss (You need to use this format /star_iss YOUR CITY) ISS Scanner duh

/star_facts Facts abt planet duh

/star_astronomy_photo uses nasa api for astronomy photo
